Topic: 
    1. Components of the robot.
        1. How does the concept of "sensor fusion" enhance a robot's perception accuracy and reliability in complex environments?
        2. Discuss the significance of "robotic grasping." How do AI and machine learning contribute to improving the success rate of robotic grasps?
        3. What is "collaborative robotics"? Provide examples of applications where robots work alongside humans to enhance productivity and safety.
        4. Discuss the concept of "human-robot interaction." How can robots be designed to understand and respond to human gestures and verbal commands effectively?
        5. Describe the concept of "soft robots." How do their deformable structures open up new possibilities in tasks that rigid robots struggle with?
        6. Discuss the concept of "robotic exoskeletons." How do these wearable devices assist individuals with mobility impairments and contribute to rehabilitation?
        7. Describe the concept of "tactile sensing" in robotics. How can robots be equipped with sensors to better understand the properties of objects they interact with?
        8. Discuss the role of "aerial drones" in various industries. What are the challenges and opportunities in using drones for tasks like surveillance and package delivery?
        9. Describe the concept of "robotic manipulation." How do robots use their end-effectors to interact with and manipulate objects in their environment?
        10. Discuss the ethical considerations surrounding "autonomous vehicles." How can AI and robotics address challenges related to decision-making in potential accidents?
    
    2. Robot assembly status by team.
        Complete the assembly of the robot within the time limit of 2 hours and draw a circle using the joystick!
        
        Tips:
            1. Check if each function of the robot is working properly.
            2. Check that the motor is working properly, the camera and lidar are working well, and there are no abnormalities in the sensors.
            3. Check once again that the screws are not assembled or are not loose.
