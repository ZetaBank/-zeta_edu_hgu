        Quiz:
            1. What type of sensor is commonly used to detect the presence of nearby objects by emitting and receiving ultrasonic waves?
            2. Which type of sensor is used to capture images of an environment and is commonly found in robots and autonomous vehicles?
            3. What is the significance of a "reducer" in a robot's joint mechanism?
            4. What is the purpose of an "inertial measurement unit" (IMU) in a robot?
            5. What is the purpose of the "rospy" library in ROS programming with Python?
            6. Describe the purpose of the "roslaunch" command-line tool in ROS. How does it simplify the process of launching and managing multiple ROS nodes, and what are some practical scenarios where "roslaunch" is particularly useful?
            7. In ROS, what is the role of a "node" in a robotic application?
            8. In ROS, what is the purpose of a "bag" file?
            9. In ROS programming using Python, what is the purpose of the "rospy.spin()" method? How does it relate to the event-driven nature of ROS nodes, and when would you use this method in your code?
            10. When implementing a PID controller in Python for a robot's position control, what does the "D" in "PID" stand for?
