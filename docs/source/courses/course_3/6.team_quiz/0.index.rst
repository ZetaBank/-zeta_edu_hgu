Topic: 
    1. AI essential questions
        1. Discuss the role of "computer vision" in robotics. How do AI techniques like convolutional neural networks improve object recognition and scene understanding?
        2. Explain the concept of "neural network control" in robotics. How can neural networks be used to improve the precision and flexibility of robotic movements?
        3. Discuss the challenges and advancements in "natural language processing" for human-robot interaction. How do robots understand and respond to human language?
        4. Describe the concept of "perception-driven robotics." How do AI algorithms enhance a robot's ability to interpret and respond to its environment?
        5. Describe the concept of "explainable AI" in robotics. How can robots provide transparent and understandable explanations for their decisions and actions?
        6. Discuss the challenges and benefits of "multi-agent reinforcement learning" in coordinating the actions of multiple robots to achieve a common goal.


    2. AI choice questions
        1. Explain the concept of "SLAM" (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) in robotics. How do AI and machine learning techniques contribute to solving the SLAM problem, and what are the key challenges in accurate simultaneous localization and mapping?
        2. Describe "reinforcement learning" algorithms in the context of robotic control. Discuss how Q-learning and policy gradient methods work, and explain the trade-offs between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning approaches.
        3. Discuss the significance of "object detection" in robotic computer vision. How do deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), improve the accuracy and speed of object detection tasks? Provide examples of object detection architectures.
        4. Elaborate on "motion planning" algorithms in robotics. How do AI algorithms enable robots to generate collision-free paths and trajectories in complex environments? Explain the A* algorithm and its variations in the context of motion planning.
